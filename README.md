# Stock-Value-Prediction-using-Sentimental-and-Emotional-Analysis
Stock value prediction by performing sentiment and emotional analysis on social media and news data. 

Stock prices fluctuate rapidly multiple times within a second. Investing in stocks using a hunch may throw us into losses, but taking an informed decision will always yield good results. There are a lot of stock value prediction models out in the market, but alas! all those models have poor accuracy.

We have worked on developing a stock value prediction model which will provide better accuracies. To build this model, the factors which influence the market value have been extracted. 
The objective of this project is to build a Stock Market sentiment analysis model using social media(Tweets,Facebook,Reddit..). We have scraped the relevant information about a company from various social media platforms, performed sentimental analysis and emotion mining along with other NLP-related tasks to define a quantified index to predict the stock price.
